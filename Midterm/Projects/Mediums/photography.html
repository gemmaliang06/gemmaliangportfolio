                    Based on a photograph taken of me and my sister on the day I was born,
                     this drawing depicts our first moment together. Illustrating a portrait 
                     in pencil transforms a picture taken in one “click” into an intimate 
                     viewing of texture and contrast to appreciate the full significance of 
                     the moment. Brought into focus by the subjects’ surrounding negative space 
                     and imaginary and actual leading lines, me and my sister’s connection is 
                     displayed by her gentle touch on my forehead.</p>

                    In my life, my mom stands as the pinnacle role model of a strong female, 
                    inspiring me with her constant proactivity and reliability as a pillar of 
                    support. With intention to demonstrate my admiration of these qualities 
                    through my art, I found that a working bee serves as a relevant metaphor for 
                    the characteristics my mom holds. A bee is at times overlooked in its 
                    integral role in supporting the outdoor environment, yet by taking a closer 
                    inspection, we can appreciate all that it creates.</p>
