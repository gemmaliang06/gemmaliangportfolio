                    Deep breath work relieves built up tension in the body and mind. 
                    To visually encapsulate this experience, this piece reflects on 
                    the ability to rely on intuitive instincts of survival to inspire 
                    others to value mindfulness in moments of stress. I chose to contrast 
                    feelings of darkness and despair with the experience of relaxation. 
                    Such darkness is represented by the deeper colour in surrounding 
                    proximity to the submerged head. As this piece was the second planned 
                    acrylic medium artwork I created, I found value in learning technical 
                    skills such as blending on canvas, colour mixing - understanding colour 
                    theory, and how to create visual movement through brushstrokes. 
                    Depicting movement through water, I found inspiration in both the 
                    natural flow and stillness of the medium. In crafting a sense of tranquility,
                     I focused on portraying serenity through the subject's face, while the 
                     parallel horizontal plane of the water surrounding them extended this 
                     feeling throughout the entirety of the painting. My attention to these 
                     details aims to invite viewers into a contemplative space, encouraging 
                     reflection on the significance of intuitive self-care amidst life's complexities.</p>

                    This painting serves as a reminder to stop, reflect and feel. Leaning on others 
                    in times of hardship is important, yet the person who should constantly be there 
                    for support is yourself. Using a monochromatic palette serves as a symbol of 
                    unity, as there is wholeness felt from within when deciding to show kindness toward 
                    oneself. Depicting this figure anonymously further directs focus to the feeling of 
                    peaceful solitude being expressed.</p>

                    The focus of this 3D piece is verbal expression and the idea is that expression is not 
                    always soft or sad, it can be radically aggressive, not because of who it is directed 
                    at but the content of the message. I aim to depict a sense of clarity through a 
                    contrast in texture, colour and depth. The layered wood elements symbolize the evolving 
                    understanding of my identity as I release repressed emotions. During my creation process, 
                    I needed to deeply consider how an intense release of expression would project through a 
                    singular facial feature. Isolating the mouth as a symbol of emotional release allowed me 
                    to further examine how the form, colour and lines that make up a mouth could be 
                    exaggerated to explore my intent. Experimentation with this topographic style of sculpting 
                    led to a new appreciation for the use of expressive lines, working in three dimensions and 
                    the use of colour. Each of these aspects I included in my artwork entirely transfers my 
                    emotions.</p>
